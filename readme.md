# Fishing Branch

## Post-hoc Validation Steps:
1. **Find PSE**:
   - Conduct the Fishing Game to collect data using both the standard (5.5) and the PSE.
2. **Perform Binomial Test**:
   - Test whether participants can distinguish between the PSE and the standard.

## Hypotheses:
- **H₀ (Null Hypothesis)**:  
  Participants cannot distinguish between the PSE and the standard stimulus.  
  (Probability \( p = 0.5 \), equivalent to random guessing.)

- **H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis)**:  
  Participants can distinguish between the PSE and the standard stimulus.  
  (Probability \( p ≠ 0.5 \), significant deviation from random guessing.)

# Treasure Branch

- Manually find the treasure and compare it with the guidance provided by Deshi.
- Note: In this process, the participant does **not** encounter the PSE.

# Questions

- **Binomial Test Feasibility**  
  Is the binomial test appropriate and feasible for validating participant responses?

- **Handling Identical Values When Plotting PSE**  
  When plotting PSE, how should identical values (e.g., 5.5 vs 5.5) be treated?  
  (e.g., consider treating them as true matches or handle them separately.)

- **PSE Across 4 Directions**  
  Should the PSE be calculated **separately for each of the 4 directions** (e.g., forward, backward, left, right)  
  or **take the average** across all directions?
-**Time record**
